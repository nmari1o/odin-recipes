   <h2>Description</h2>

   <p>Shortened in length, the term Burger is used to describe
        a popular sandwich made from ground meats that are formed into a patty, 
        cooked, and placed between two halves of a bun. Although the most common Burger is 
        made with meat, there are many alternatives that do not include meat, such as tofu 
        or ground vegetables.</p>
