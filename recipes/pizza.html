   <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, 
       flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, 
       and often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies,
        mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a 
        high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes 
        called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>
